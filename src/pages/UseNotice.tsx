        <div>
          We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site,
          including, without limitation:
          <ul>
            <li>Chat rooms.</li>
            <li>Bulletin boards.</li>
            <li>Comments</li>
          </ul>
          Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear
          information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is
          moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is
          human or technical). We will do our best to assess any possible risks
          for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when
          they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will
          decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the
          relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the
          light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee,
          monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site,
          and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising
          from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of
          our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not. The
          use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the
          consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit
          their children to use an interactive service that it is important that
          they communicate with their children about their safety online, as
          moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive
          service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. Where we
          do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with
          a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty
          arise.
